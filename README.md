# imgshuffler
## I had an idea, seemingly random and creative enough to instill in me a drive to do it.

Some year ago I thought to myself "hey, python is easy enough to use, can I manipulate images with it without any difficulty?" 
Turns out that yes, we can. 

Although I've finished writting this script with a feeling that it could be way simpler, I learned quite a bit making it and it was fun.

It is still unusable as a "tool to mix images' channels into new images", but I believe the concepts learned are what mattered in the end.

## How to use

Install the Pillow lib for Python3 
  `python -m pip install --upgrade pillow`

To use the script. 
  `python imgshuf.py imgsize img1 img2 img3`
  imgsize is the size of the three new images to be generated
  img1, img2, img3 are the respective source images to be "shuffled"
